<b>Abstract of the paper<b></br>The Internet of Things(IoT) has revolutionalized
the world and quality of life around us and it is bringing a
revolution in each field where we never thought it is possible.
One such field where automation and IoT have brought about
considerable changes is home security. Across the globe, personal
and home security has been a major concern in every household.
Home security systems are a useful addition to todayâ€™s homes
where most of the family members go out of the house for
their daily activities at the same time. Vision-based security
systems have the advantage of being easy to set up, inexpensive
and unobtrusive. The traditional home security systems, i.e.,
closed circuit television (CCTV) can only capture the video
without being able to give any warning feedback if there is any
suspicious object.
Our project Safe Locking System (Safe Nest) aims to design
and implement a home security system with the capability
for human detection with additional functionalities such as
Smart weather information and suggestions, garage door open
notification. It is developed using sensors to detect any security
violation and sends out the alert signal to your mobile device. Our
project has following features a) Burglary detection, b) Automatic
Main-Door and Garage-Door opening mechanism, c) Auto Light
Turn On/Off d) Weather sensor e) Garage door open alert. Our
project utilizes Omnet++ as a simulation environment to simulate
sensor nodes, data transmission to local controller and to the
local station. We have used Python3 for logic implementation
and would be manually feeding certain input data to depict the
functioning of the Safe Nest App. If any abnormality is detected,
then alerts are
